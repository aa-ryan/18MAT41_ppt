* Hi all, today I am going to present on conformal transformation.

* A conformal mapping, also called a conformal map, conformal transformation, angle-preserving transformation, or biholomorphic map, is a transformation w=f(z) that preserves local angles.

* Conformal map preserves both angles and shape of infinitesimal small figures but not necessarily their size.

* Face is potentially the best biometrics for people identification related applications for its non instructiveness, contactless and socially well acceptance.

* Unfortunately, face recognition in 2D proves to be a very challenging task as intra-class variations, dues to factors as diverse as pose, lighting conditions, facial expressions, etc., are often much greater than inter-class variations.

* While 3D face models are theoretically insensible to lighting condition changes, they still require to be pose normal- ized before 3D facial shape-based matching. Moreover, as 3D face models describe 3D facial shapes, they are also more sensible to facial expression changes as compared to their 2D counterpart.

* The proposed approach makes use of conformal UV parameterization for mapping purpose and Shape Index decomposition for similarity measurement. Indeed, according to conformal geometry theory, each 3D surface with disk topology can be mapped onto a 2D domain through a global optimization, resulting in a diffeomorphism (isomorphism of smooth manifolds), i.e., one-to-one and onto.

* This allows us to reduce the 3D surface matching problem to a 2D image matching one by comparing the corresponding 2D conformal geometric maps.

* Rasterization is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image (a series of pixels, dots or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes).

* Variations by facial expressions are a major challenge in 3D face recognition. Facial conformal maps so far generated have reduced a 3D shape matching problem to a 2D one while preserving facial topology. However, they are still facial expression sensitive. In order to decrease such a sensibility, we propose to make use of Mobius transformation to ’compress’ facial elastic regions, i.e. the lower part of a face model. For this purpose, the center of a conformal map is moved to the nose tip of the face. Then Mo ̈bius transformation is carried out on UV conformal coordinates.
